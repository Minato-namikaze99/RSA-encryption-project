# RSA-encryption-project
This is a RSA Encryption program that I made in Python. I have not used any external libraries and built it from scratch.

I made this by watching the video which you can find by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_PfV_IcUdA)

This project does not require any extra libraries, so, you can run this just like this!
